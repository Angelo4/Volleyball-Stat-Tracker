# VolleyLog
This project contains the VolleyLog web app. Navigate to the `volleyball-stat-tracker-app` folder and follow the `README.md` to run the webapp on your local machine.

VolleyLog is an app where you can record, save and track your personal or team stats. See your stats visualized to help breakdown your attacking, defense and setting abilities!
